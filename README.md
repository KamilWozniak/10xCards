## üéØ Project Description

**10x-cards** is an innovative educational tool designed to solve the time-consuming problem of creating high-quality flashcards. The application integrates with LLM (Large Language Model) APIs to automatically generate flashcard suggestions from user-provided text (1,000-10,000 characters), which users can review, edit, accept, or reject.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Flashcard Generation**: Paste text and let AI generate flashcard suggestions automatically
- **Manual Flashcard Management**: Create, edit, and delete flashcards manually
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system with account management
- **Spaced Repetition Learning**: Learning sessions powered by an external spaced repetition algorithm
- **Privacy-First**: All user flashcards are private and only accessible to the flashcard owner
- **GDPR Compliant**: User data stored in compliance with GDPR regulations
- **Generation Statistics**: Track how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many were accepted

### User Problem

Manual creation of high-quality flashcards requires significant time and effort, which discourages users from utilizing the effective learning method of spaced repetition. This application aims to reduce the time needed to create appropriate questions and answers while simplifying the learning material management process.
